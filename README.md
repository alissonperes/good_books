## Live Demo

[Live version :gem:](https://infinite-meadow-25243.herokuapp.com/).

## Getting Started

This APP will use PostgreSQL, so make sure you have it installed in your development and test environment. This could be changed in the `./config/database.yml` file if needed.

Also note that the database expects to have a specific user with a password (also in `database.yml` file).

Feel free to create more entries in the `db/seeds.rd` file to generate more content.

To get started with the APP, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Then, make many moc data to interaction:

```
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
